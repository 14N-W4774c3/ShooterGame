This project only superficially looks like my design from the document.
This is due to the difficulties I had implementing... pretty much anything to do with the enemies.
Future projects will be the absolute minimum, as I clearly don't have the skill to manage to implement any flourishes whatsoever within the duration provided.

Difficulty: 7/10
Time Spent: 12-16 hrs

At least this time I was able to cut my additions out of the design.  The Link-based game didn't have that luxury.

Controls:
A and D - Left and right motion
Space to shoot
